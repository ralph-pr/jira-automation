# jira-automation
Automation related to Jira using python and Groovy.

## Groovy
Groovy scripts include examples of various customizations in Jira that can be accomplished using the ScriptRunner app as well as certain admin troubleshooting scripts that can be run directly from the ScriptRunner Console within the Jira admin section.

## Python
Python files provide examples of Atlassian admin tasks that are automated externally and interact with Jira/Confluence via their native APIs. These scripts are used to automate the toil of the admin team. These include Lambda functions triggered by events such as a new user login to nightly processes to manual incident mitigation tasks.
